            <h2>The Legend: Bhagat Singh</h2>
            <p> <b>Bhagat Singh</b> was one of India’s most courageous and visionary revolutionaries, whose life became a symbol of resistance against British colonial rule. Born into a family with a strong history of patriotism, he grew up hearing stories of bravery, sacrifice, and the struggle for freedom. Inspired by these values from childhood, Bhagat Singh dedicated himself fully to the fight for independence, believing that true freedom required not just protest, but fearless action.
            As a young revolutionary, he challenged injustice in every form and became a powerful voice for the youth of India. His famous slogan “Inquilab Zindabad” became the heartbeat of the freedom movement, motivating countless people to stand up against oppression. Bhagat Singh was known not only for his bravery but also for his sharp intellect—he read extensively, wrote passionately, and dreamed of an India built on equality, justice, and unity.
            Even though he was executed at the young age of 23, the impact he left on the nation was far greater than his years. His sacrifice transformed him into an everlasting icon of courage, inspiring generations to fight for truth and freedom. Today, Bhagat Singh is remembered as a hero whose revolutionary spirit continues to guide and motivate India.
